        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">How to get your help</h2>

        <p>In most cases, you don't have to do anything more, although you may have to show proof you get Income-related Employment and Support Allowance to your pharmacist, optician or dentist.</p>

        <p>You can use your latest benefit letter or award notice as proof. If you have lost yours contact the <a
                href="https://www.gov.uk/contact-jobcentre-plus/existing-benefit-claims" target="_blank">Jobcentre Plus Helpline (opens in new tab)</a>.
        </p>

        <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Help with travel for NHS treatment</h3>

        <p>Tell the hospital (or the place where you're getting treatment) that you want to claim back the cost of your
            journey. They'll tell you what you need to do.</p>

        <p>You may need to show proof:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>of your travel costs, for example, bus tickets</li>
            <li>that you're entitled to help</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="nhsuk-warning-callout">
            <h4 class="nhsuk-warning-callout__label">Warning</h4>
            <p>It's important you know what benefit you get - you can get a fine if you claim help with NHS costs and
                you're not entitled.</p>
